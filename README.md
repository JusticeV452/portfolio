# My Portfolio

This repository is the source code for my portfolio website, which is running on an AWS server I set up with Nginx and is accessible at https://jm-vidal.com.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and can be run locally using the command `npm start`.
